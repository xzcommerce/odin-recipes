    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>'Cappuccino' comes from Latin Caputium, later borrowed in German/Austrian and modified into Kapuziner. It is the diminutive form of cappuccio in Italian, meaning "hood" or something that covers the head, thus cappuccino literally means "small capuchin".</p>
    <p>The coffee beverage has its name not from the hood but from the colour of the hooded robes worn by monks and nuns of the Capuchin order.[13] This colour is quite distinctive, and capuchin was a common description of the colour of red-brown in 17th century Europe.</p>
